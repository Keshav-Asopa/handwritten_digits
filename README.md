# handwritten_digits
Building	a	classifier	to	solve	the	problem	of	identifying	specific
handwriting	samples	from	a	dataset	of	images.	We've	been	asked	(in	this
hypothetical	use	case)	to	do	this	by	a	restaurant	chain	that	has	the	need	to
accurately	classify	handwritten	numbers	into	digits.	What	they	have	their
customers	do	is	write	their	phone	numbers	in	a	simple	iPad	application.	At	the
time	when	they	can	be	seated,	the	guest	will	get	a	text	prompting	them	to	come
and	see	the	restaurant's	host.	We	need	to	accurately	classify	the	handwritten
numbers,	so	that	the	output	from	the	app	will	be	accurately	predicted	labels	for
the	digits	of	a	phone	number.	This	can	then	be	sent	to	their	(hypothetical)	auto
dialer	service	for	text	messages,	and	the	notice	gets	to	the	right	hungry	customer!
